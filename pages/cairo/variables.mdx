# Variables

Variables in Cairo can be aliased or evaluated. There are 4 different types of variables:

1. `let`: References
   - Can be revoked
   - Can be redefined
   - Can be value references (e.g. `let foo = 42`)
   - Can be expression references (e.g. `let bar = foo`)
2. `tempvar`: Temporary Variables
   - Can be revoked (because they rely on `ap`)
   - Can be redefined
   - Based on `ap` register
   - Auto-increment the `ap` register
3. `const`: Constants
   - Cannot be revoked
   - Cannot be redefined
   - Only integers
   - Simple replacement by the Cairo compiler (not translated into a Cairo instruction)
4. `local`: Local Variables
   - Cannot be revoked
   - Can be redefined
   - Based on `fp` register
   - Do not auto-increment the `ap` register

## Example

````cairo
# Constants can be defined at the top level to be accessible by all functions.
const meaning_of_life = 42

func main():
    # `alloc_locals` is required to use Local Variables.
    # `alloc_locals` is translated to `ap += SIZEOF_LOCALS` behind the scenes.
    alloc_locals

    # References
    let reference = 42
    let reference = 43

    # Temporary Variables
    # The following code is equivalent to:
    #   ```
    #   [ap] = 42; ap++
    #   let tmp = [ap - 1]
    #   ```
    tempvar tmp = 42
    tempvar tmp = 43

    # Constants
    const constant = 42
    # `const` variables cannot be redefined.
    # const constant = 43

    # Local Variables
    # The following code is equivalent to:
    #   ```
    #   [fp + 0] = 42
    #   [fp + 1] = 43
    #   ```
    local x = 42
    local y = 43

    local x = 43

    return ()
end
