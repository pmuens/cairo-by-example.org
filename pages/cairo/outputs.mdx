# Outputs

Outputs can be written to standard output via the `output` builtin.

The CLI options `--layout=small` and `--print_output` need to be provided to the `cairo-run` command to see the output.

Once the `output` builtin is added, one can write to the `output_ptr` which has to be provided as an implicit argument to the `main` function.

Run a Cairo program like the following to see the program's output: `cairo-run program.cairo --layout=small --program_output`.

## Example

```cairo
# This `builtin` is necessary to support program outputs.
%builtins output

from starkware.cairo.common.serialize import serialize_word

# Main now gets the `output_ptr` as an implicit argument.
func main{output_ptr : felt*}():
    let number = 42

    # We can use `serialize_word` to print a value...
    serialize_word(number)

    # ...or use the `output_ptr` directly.
    # Write the value `42` to memory.
    [ap] = number

    # # Point the `output_ptr` to the memory location with the value `42`.
    [ap] = [output_ptr]; ap++
    # # return the value of `output_ptr` which was advanced by 1.
    [ap] = output_ptr + 1; ap++

    ret
end
```
