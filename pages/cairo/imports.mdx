# Imports

Cairo programs can be split up into multiple source files to ensure modularity and code-reuse.

Cairo will automatically detect multiple imports with the same name as well as cyclic imports.

By default Cairo searches the current directory and the standard library directory relative to the compiler path. This behavior can be extended via the `--cairo_path` option and the `CAIRO_PATH` environment variable:

```sh
cairo-compile --cairo_path="/foo/bar/baz/my_libraries" ...
CAIRO_PATH="/foo/bar/baz/my_libraries" cairo-compile ...
```

Consider the following source code directory:

```sh
|__this_file.cairo
|__dir_a
    |__foo.cairo
    |__dir_b
        |__bar.cairo
```

## Example

```cairo
# We can import tokens such as functions, structs, etc. from
#   the `a.cairo` file like this.
from dir_a.foo import calculate_radius

# Imports can aliased via the `as` keyword.
from dir_a.foo import calculate_radius as radius

# Multiple tokens can be imported by listing them comma-separated.
from dir_a.foo import Circle, calculate_radius

# Tokens in files located in nested directories can be accessed by chaining file- and directory names via dots.
from dir_a.dir_b.bar import Square, calculate_area
```
